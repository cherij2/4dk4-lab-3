Computer Engineering 4DK4 Lab 3 Call Blocking in Circuit Switched Networks

This lab first investigates call blocking in a circuit switched network. Call arrivals
occur to a cellular basestation containing N communication channels. If a channel is
available when a call arrives, it is assigned to the call for its duration, otherwise the
call is blocked. A computer simulation is used to assess the blocking behaviour of the
system with Poisson process call arrivals and exponentially distributed call holding
times. The simulation results are compared to theory using the Erlang B formula. The
case is then considered where incoming calls are not blocked but permitted to queue
up until service is available. This system is simulated and compared to theory using
the Erlang C formula. Finally, code is written that simulates a company that operates
a fleet of N taxis that service incoming call requests. Results are obtained that assess
the behaviour of the system.
